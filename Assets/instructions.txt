open folder "unityRaytracer" in unity
Doubleclick on myscene in "Projects" tab in Assets folder view
In rendering window select "2D" in "Scene" tab
You should see a green or magenta colored quad
Zoom in or out on it using the scroll wheel.
If it is magenta, the shader is not attached to the quad. To attach it do this
	-drag "material" in Assets folder over to the magenta Quad in the rendering window
	-drag "Raytracer0 - green" shader in Assets folder over to "material" in assets folder
Whenever you implement a new functionality, store it as a a new shader. Then you can switch between them by dragging them over the material

To open the shader in an editor, double click on it (Raytracer0 - green)
When the code is changed and the file is saved in editor and unity gets focus, the change will show up immediately.
